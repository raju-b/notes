# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
User.create(email: "admin@lib.com", type: "Admin", password: 12345678, password_confirmation: 12345678)
